EFS and S3 are both storage services, but they serve different purposes and use cases.
Use case:

EFS is suited for applications that require a shared file system (which is what we did in this project), such as content management systems, big data applications, or containerized applications.
S3 is designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
